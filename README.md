## Overview
This project contains of 9 small Python programms - weekly tasks, a histogram of a normal distribution plot.png and a txt file used for es.py program.

- .gitgnore 
- README.md  # Documentation for the project
- accounts.py # Program that asks a user to input and  stores 10 character strings, displays only 4 last characters, rest replacers with Xs

- helloworld.py # Program that displays Hello World! 
- moby-dick.txt # Text file used by es.py
- plot.png # Histogram plot generated by plottask.py
- plottask.py # Program thats plots a histogram of a normal distribution ad=nd of the function $h(x)=x^3$ The plot is saved as plot.png
- squareroot.py # Program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root
